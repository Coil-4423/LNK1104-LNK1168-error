The error message indicates that access to the path `cd\main.exe` is denied. This can happen due to several reasons:

### Possible Causes and Solutions:

1. **File Locked by Another Process:**
   - **Cause:** The `main.exe` file might still be running or is being used by another process, which is preventing access.
   - **Solution:** Check the **Task Manager** for any running instances of `main.exe` and terminate them. Additionally, close any other applications that might be using this file.

2. **Permission Issues:**
   - **Cause:** You might not have the necessary permissions to access or modify the file in the specified directory.
   - **Solution:** Ensure you have the required permissions. Right-click the `main.exe` file (if it exists) and select **Properties** -> **Security**. Check that your user account has full control. If not, you might need to adjust the permissions.

3. **Conflict with OneDrive:**
   - **Cause:** Since the project is located in a OneDrive-synced folder, OneDrive might be locking the file during synchronization.
   - **Solution:** Temporarily pause OneDrive syncing and try building the project again. If this resolves the issue, consider moving your project out of the OneDrive folder to avoid future conflicts.

4. **Antivirus Software:**
   - **Cause:** Antivirus software might be blocking access to the `main.exe` file as it might perceive the build process as a threat.
   - **Solution:** Temporarily disable your antivirus software or add an exception for the directory containing your project.

5. **File in Use by Another Application:**
   - **Cause:** Sometimes, IDEs or other tools might lock the file even after execution.
   - **Solution:** Restart Visual Studio and try building the project again. Also, check if any other instances of the file are open in the background.

6. **Cleaning the Build Directory:**
   - **Cause:** The build directory might have residual files from previous builds that are causing conflicts.
   - **Solution:** Clean the solution in Visual Studio by going to **Build** -> **Clean Solution**. This will remove all compiled files and allow a fresh build.

Ensure that no other processes are using the file should help.
